            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The name Surakarta Hadiningrat followed the instincts of the ancestors, that the Mataram Kingdom was centered in Karta, then to Pleret, then moved to Wanakarta, which was later changed its name to Kartasura. Surakarta Hadiningrat means hope for the creation of a state that is peaceful and orderly karta raharja (orderly, safe and peaceful), and must be accompanied by determination and courage to face all obstacles that stand in the way (sura) to realize a beautiful world life (Hadiningrat). Thus, the word "Karta" was re-emerged as a form of asking for blessings from the forefathers and the establishment of the Mataram kingdom. </p>

            <p>The history of the name of the city of Solo itself is because this area used to be overgrown with Sala trees (a type of pine tree) as written in the Babad Sengkala fiber which is stored in Sana Budaya Yogyakarta. Sala comes from the original Javanese language (Javanese pronunciation: Solo) In the end people know him by the name of Solo City.</p>

        <article id="geographical" class="card">
            <h2>Geographical</h2>
            <p>Solo is located in the lowlands at an altitude of 105 m above sea level and in the city center 95 m above sea level, with an area of ​​44.1 km2 (0.14% of Central Java area). Surakarta is located about 65 km northeast of Yogyakarta, 100 km southeast of Semarang and 260 km southwest of Surabaya and is surrounded by Mount Merbabu (3145 m high) and Merapi (2930 m high) in the west, and Mount Lawu (3265 m high) in the west. east. Some distance to the south lies the Sewu Mountains. The land around the city is fertile because it is surrounded by Bengawan Solo, the longest river in Java, and is passed by Kali Anyar, Kali Pepe, and Kali Jenes.[21] The springs are sourced from the slopes of Mount Merapi, totaling 19 locations, with a capacity of 3,404 l/second.</p>

            <p>Soil in Solo is sandy with a high young mineral composition as a result of the volcanic activity of Merapi and Lawu. This composition, coupled with the abundant availability of water, makes this lowland very good for the cultivation of food crops, vegetables, and industries, such as tobacco and sugar cane. However, since the last 20 years, the manufacturing and tourism industries have grown rapidly, resulting in many changes in land use for industrial activities and residential housing.</p>

                <p>The Heritage Palace is one of the relatively new tourist attractions in Solo, which was opened in mid-2018. This place was originally a sugar factory inherited from the Netherlands from 1892 which was revitalized into a family tourist spot.
                    If you are a selfie hobbyist, you will definitely be satisfied here, because almost every corner of the place which is thick with classic European nuances is very Instagrammable and memorable as if not in Indonesia. You can even rent a costume you know. Oh yes, our favorite spot is of course the walls of the main building which reminds of the castle in the Game of Thrones series!</p>
